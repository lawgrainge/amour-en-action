  "testimony": "I am blessed to be able to work with committed disciples of Jesus who are working to make a difference in the lives of people who are the least of the Master's brothers and sisters.You are a reminder that, \"little does become much,\" when you place it in the Master's hands. Keep up the work of the Lord and His blessings will flow; not only upon you but also onto the lives of the people you touch, and countless others that you neither see or know. Thank you for touching my life and the lives of the people who help me to help you. THANKS!!!!!!!"
