  "testimony": "I am a nurse practitioner that has been going on medical mission trips to Haiti on a yearly basis since 2007 with Amour-en-Action.  My work entails taking care of the sick by assisting and prioritizing the medical needs of my patients. I also administer and reconcile medications.  In addition, I perform wound care and assist the physicians during various procedures.  I feel very good each time I participate with this organization knowing that I make a difference in the lives that I serve.  My prayer is for God to bless Amour-en-Action so that it can continue to serve and provide this needed service for many years."
